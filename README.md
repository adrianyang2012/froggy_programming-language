#this is a programming language using text
#how to use
This is a new programming language that you can use! there are 3 functions. say, ask, and var!
If you use say, you can either put variable names, math stuff, or strings(but you need to type str before it to make it a string). 
You can do the same things for var and putting it in this format: var var_name = value and the value can be string, math stuff, or other variables using the same rules as say like using str before a string. 
You can also add a ask after the equal sign in var. Then you can type your question and it will be stored on the variable.
