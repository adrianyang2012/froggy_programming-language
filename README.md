This is a new programming language that you can use! there are 3 functions. say, ask, endline, and var!

If you use say, you can either put variable names, math stuff, or strings(but you need to type str before it to make it a string). 

You can do the same things for var and putting it in this format: var var_name = value and the value can be string, math stuff, or other variables using the same rules as say like using str before a string. 

You can also add a ask after the equal sign in var. Then you can type your question and it will be stored on the variable.

If you want the next line to not go to the next line and stay on this line then you can use the endline functions by writing endline no for no next line and endline yes for yes next line
